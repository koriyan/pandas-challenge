## Heroes of Pymoli

I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like me to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Three observable trends based on the data
•	Among all the players, male players take the lion's share with more than 84% of the total number.
•	Almost half of the players are in the age range of 20-24. They also purchase more items and spend more money on the game.
•	Final Critic is the most popular and the most profitable item.
